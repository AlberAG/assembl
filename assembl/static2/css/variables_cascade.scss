/* This file is meant to define cascade variables. Cascade variables are variables which definition in a theme is not mandatory, but which by default have a value that depend on other theme variables. So if these theme variables they depend on are re-defined in a theme, cascade variables would have to use changed values. For this, we use the "!default" keyword of SCSS. */
