Updating Fonts and Icons in Assembl
===================================

The point of Fontello_ is to create font files from a list of icons, so that we can show an icon on a page by showing a special character of this font, using CSS rules. Fontello_ provides presets of icons that we can pick, to compose our custom font. We can also import our own SVG files into Fontello_ so that they are converted into a font character of our custom font.

So there are two use cases:

* If you want to use in Assembl an icon that exists on the Fontello_ website but that is not part of Assembl's current collection of Fontello icons, then follow the instructions below to add an existing Fontello icon to our custom font.
* On the other hand, if you want to use in Assembl a new icon that is not part of the Fontello_ website and that you have as an image file:
  * If your icon image is a vector image file (SVG format), and does not need any special formatting, like most icons, then you SHOULD import it into our Fontello_ custom font.
  * If your icon image can only be a raster image (JPG, PNG formats) because of color constraints, then you can just add it in the `assembl/static2/img/icons` (or `assembl/static/img/icon` for Assembl v1 UI) folder and use it in your code. 

There are currently (as of 06/28/2017) two methods in using Fontello in order to update icons and fonts
in Assembl, depending on which version of Assembl's UI you want the icon to appear in.


Assembl Version 1
-----------------

To add icons to Fontello, first run ``fab devenv start_edit_fontello_fonts``.
This will open a web page on Fontello with our icons preselected, and initialize a local ID.
Select more icons on this page, upload SVG files, and name them as "name" not "icon-name". When you are done, run ``fab devenv compile_fontello_fonts``. The updated fonts will be in ``assembl/static/css/fonts``, add them with git.
You need to add them on _icon.scss with the right unicode. You have to clear the cache to see them on Chrome.

To edit the svg paths themselves, take the SVG paths in config.json and edit them in a svg editor, such as http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/branches/stable/editor/svg-editor.html


Assembl Version 2
-----------------

To add icons to Fontello_, visit the website first. Create the environment that Assembl currently has on the platform
by uploading the :download:`assembl/static2/config.json` file.

If you want to add an icon that is not part of the Fontello_ website and that you have as an image file (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc), then drag and drop it from your computer file explorer to the Fontello_ page.

After updating icons on Fontello, re-download the icons and update the following:

- Copy/paste to override the :download:`assembl/static2/config.json` with the latest version of this file
- Copy/paste to override the fonts files (\*\.woff, \*\.woff2, \*\.ttf, \*\.eot, etc) files to the files hosted under ``assembl/static2/fonts/`` folder.
- Update :download:`assembl/static2/css/components/assembl-glyph.scss` in order to have the latest CSS versions of the icons available to you. An example is shown below.
  You should update the hash in the font urls to force the browser to download the new fonts.
- Add your icons name in the icons variable at the top of the :download:`assembl/static2/js/app/components/styleguide/icons.jsx` file.

.. code-block:: scss

	// Add a new line similar in fashion to the template shown below
	// .assembl-icon-<icon-name>:before { content: <Icon Bytecode>; } /* <Shape of the icon> */
	// For example:

	.assembl-icon-google:before { content: '\f1a0'; } /* 'ï† ' */

.. note::

	Be careful if you decide to change this directory, as you must also update the Webpack process in order to accomodate the new location for the fonts. The fonts directory, which is consumed in the stylesheets is defined in ``assembl/static2/css/variables.scss``. The definition is shown below.

.. code-block:: scss

	$fonts-dir: '/static2/fonts';

.. _Fontello: http://fontello.com
